# Algorithm
This repository includes modular implementation of common algorithms and data structures.

# Algorithn 4th edition
These algorithms are covered in Sedgewick's book. Implementations are already given in the book. The code here is a reimplementation. Lots of details are modified to achieve better performance or readability(plausibly).
